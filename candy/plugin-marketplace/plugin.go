// Package marketplace is the charly plugin housing the `charly marketplace …` CLI — the
// generator that regenerates the ENTIRE `charly-plugins` marketplace + harness surface from
// candy config. It reads every candy's `skill:` / `hook:` / `marketplace:` kind entities,
// aggregates them by marketplace family, and emits the corpus into --out (the standalone
// opencharly/marketplace repo root) + the .claude/ hooks + settings + the R0 dispatcher into
// --root (the charly checkout). `charly marketplace drift` is the fail-closed no-op gate.
//
// command:marketplace — `charly marketplace generate|drift`. This plugin is deliberately NOT
// listed in charly/charly.yml's compiled_plugins: it is a DEV-TIME generator, run on a
// contributor's machine to regenerate the harness surface, and has no business inside every
// shipped static charly binary. So it takes the OUT-OF-PROCESS placement (the plugin-docs
// model): the host prescans the declared `marketplace` word into the Kong grammar before parse
// and syscall.Exec's this binary in CLI mode (sdk.Main → CliMain) on first invocation.
//
// The generator is SELF-CONTAINED — it reads files and writes files, never reaching the host
// reverse channel — which is what makes the out-of-process placement free here. Invoke(OpRun)
// dispatches to the SAME entry point as CliMain, so the plugin stays placement-invisible even
// though out-of-process is the placement it actually ships in.
